User-facing release notes live in [docs/release-notes.md](docs/release-notes.md).

## 0.3.0

### Security

- Added `AuthorizationMode` with fail-closed `DeclaredPoliciesRequired` and
  `ExplicitPolicyForAllExposedOperations` modes. Default remains
  `LegacyPermissive` for one migration release; production should opt into
  `DeclaredPoliciesRequired`.
- Public GraphQL errors now use stable codes via `OrmPublicError` /
  `OrmErrorCode`. SQL and configuration strings are not exposed by default
  (**breaking** for callers that parsed raw infrastructure messages).
- `AuthSubject` and `DbAuthContext` redact sensitive claim bodies in `Debug`.
- DataLoader / auth cache keys fingerprint claims instead of embedding raw JSON.
- Event sender locks recover from poisoning instead of panicking.
- Pagination defaults reduced from 1000/1000 to 50/100 (**breaking**). Use
  `PaginationConfig::legacy()` during migration.
- Added structural tenant/owner authorization helpers for backend-independent
  predicates.
- Added optional `auth-agql` bridge mapping `agql_auth::AuthPrincipal` →
  `AuthSubject` / `DbAuthContext`, pinned to upstream
  `agql-auth` 0.7.0 (`rev = 5e7f230b96350f55496477c11f8a0505e6438779`) with no
  path/`[patch]` overrides.

### Fixed

- **SQLite migration idempotency:** column defaults such as `unixepoch()` and
  `(unixepoch())` are now treated as equivalent during planning, hashing, and
  live-schema introspection. Reopening a file-backed SQLite database and
  replanning the same managed schema no longer emits a false `AlterColumn`
  step that breaks `ApplyOptions::additive_only` restarts. Canonicalization is
  general for balanced outer parentheses and SQL keyword/boolean defaults; it
  does not weaken additive-only validation for real changes.

### Added

- `AccessContext` / `SystemAccess` for deliberate repository system authority.
- `FilterExpression::TrustedFragment` and `trusted_fragment` constructor.
- `canonicalize_column_default_expression` for shared default comparison.
- Documentation: strict authorization, error codes, agql-auth bridge,
  cross-backend tenant isolation, pagination migration.

### Migration

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## 0.2.21

- Added `AuthSubject`, upgraded `AuthExt`, exact-scope `ScopeEntityPolicy`, and `DbAuthContext`
  constructors.
- Added generated resolver auth modes on entities and schema roots.
- Kept `auth_user()` as a deprecated alias for source compatibility.
- Added a reserved optional `auth-agql` feature; concrete agql-auth converters are deferred until
  the upstream agql-auth 0.7 API is tagged.

See the 0.2.21 section in [docs/release-notes.md](docs/release-notes.md#0221) and the migration
guide in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
